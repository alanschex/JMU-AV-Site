The transportation industry is currently undergoing a drastic shift towards autonomous vehicles (AV) and processes. It is likely that autonomous transportation systems will be deployed within retirement communities significantly sooner than they are available to the general public: these communities have a particularly acute need for assisted mobility, and the controlled environment of a retirement campus simplifies many of the technical problems related to autonomous control. The elderly population has a relatively high prevalence of physical, sensory and cognitive limitations that must be addressed in the design of an AV system. We believe that a successful user interface in this domain will require a high level of passenger awareness. External and in-vehicle sensors will monitor the position, activities and mental state of passengers. The user interface will use that information to guide passenger interactions. For example, raising the volume of spoken instructions if a passenger is having difficulty hearing, or calling for assistance if a passenger is having difficulty entering or exiting the vehicle. The central research questions that we consider are 1) How can machine learning models be used to extract relevant passenger information? 2) How should an AV user interface incorporate passenger monitoring data to provide safe and reliable mobility service for the elderly? In earlier work, we developed an autonomous golf cart that provides the key capabilities required for autonomous passenger transport. The proposed work will build on that foundation to address the research questions outlined above. We propose to: 1) Equip our autonomous vehicle with a sensor suite that will enable the collection of passenger data suitable for training machine learning models. 2) Develop and train machine learning models to extract passenger information that can be used by the user interface. 3) Prototype a passenger-aware user interface. 4) Validate the user interface design through user trials.
